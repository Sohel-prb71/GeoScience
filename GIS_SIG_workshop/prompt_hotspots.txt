You are a skilled data analyst familiar with crime data and have expert knowledge in geographic information systems and spatial data science.

With that in mind, I would like you to generate a Python script that will work with ArcGIS Pro ArcPy to accomplish the following tasks:

Run the Hot Spot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) on a shapefile called robbery_census.shp, located in the C:\temp directory.

Save the output shapefile to C:\temp, naming it robbery_hotspots.shp.

When running the Hot Spot Analysis tool, you must use these exact parameters:

Input_Feature_Class: robbery_census.shp

Input_Field: Join_Count

Output_Feature_Class: robbery_hotspots.shp

Conceptualization_of_Spatial_Relationships: FIXED_DISTANCE_BAND

Distance_Band_or_Threshold_Distance: 1817.2120

Standardization: NONE

Distance_Method: EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE

Important:
The ArcGIS Hot Spot Analysis tool expects a Standardization method (NONE or ROW).
Ensure that all parameters are correctly assigned using named arguments, not positional arguments, so that the code works without ArcPy execution errors.

Provide extensive comments in the code to explain each step.
Include error handling for missing files and tool execution failures.
Provide simple user feedback via print statements as the process is running so the user knows what is happening.
Do not create a new map or workspace â€” just use the specified shapefiles and paths.
